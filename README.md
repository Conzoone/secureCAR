# secureCAR



Imagine a car that can detect its own failures and make decisions to protect its integrity. The goal of the secureCAR project is to provide a fully equipped car that can handle interactions with its environment.

Failures can occur into the system and affect the ability of the car to correctly answer orders from the user. Secure Car is able to detect various types of failures and notify the user. According to these failures, the car is able to make decision to stop or to block some of its features.
